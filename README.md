# Mouse mover
I really hate when my status on games or chats goes to offline just because I haven't moved my mouse recently. 

So I decided to write a simple code to do this for me.
In my reseeach I found PyAutoGUI https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

I used the mouse control functions to move the mouse in random spots in the set quadrant of coordinates. The quadrant is defined by x and y.
Then the time modules defines when the mouse should be moved - in this case every 2 seconds
